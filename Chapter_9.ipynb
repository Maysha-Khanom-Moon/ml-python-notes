    "- Generally k-fold cross validation is the gold standard for evaluation.\n",
    "- Train/Test split is good for speed when using a slow algorithm and produces performance estimates with lower bias when using large datasets.\n",
    "- Leave-one-out cross validation and repeated random splits can be useful intermediates when trying to balance variance in the estimated performance, model training speed and dataset size"
